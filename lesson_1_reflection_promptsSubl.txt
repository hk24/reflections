How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Fill in your answer here
It helped me see where the codes in the two versions are different. 
It narrowed the code to where in the line of code it is different. 
This helps save time. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fill in your answer here
It will help you spots changes or bring back changes that are lost.
It will help you see all the changes made by your team. 
It will go back to previous files that are less buggy if you end up with big issues. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here
The pros are you can see the history of progress for you development and learn from it.
You can commit in areas you feel you did the most changes and system where you don’t 
have too many commits that will make it harder to go through. 
The cons could be you forgot to commit when you should have or maybe you’re going through
someone project that didn’t commit in the right areas (adding more work for you). 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here
Git allows multiple files in one commit because it is made mainly for programming in mind. 
Programmers can come across all kinds of issues with code and allowing to comment helps 
go back to code and compare to solve problems faster. 
Google Docs is made for all kinds of files and therefore saved files for you. 
It is made for all kinds of users. 
Git lets you also collect group of commits called repository.
This allows you to save all your commits and see the “diff” btw each change. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
After installing git, you can access files downloaded offline. 
You use git log to find the commits in the repository. 
You use got diff to show lines of codes that have been added or erased and see what 
changes have been made. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fill in your answer here
Using version control makes me more confident in making changes by using the right 
approach to find the versions and always updating/saving the latest commit. If you 
practise and understand how to go to previous commits to find issues to fix then apply 
it to your new code, the practise will make you better in git and developing. You might
make some mistakes and break some things but in the long run it is worth it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Fill in your answer here
I want to use Git for my future project’s in my Udacity courses and personal projects. 
I am excited and can wait to learn more in the lessons. The colours make the experience 
much better and easier to understand.
